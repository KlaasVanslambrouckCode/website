           Hi! Nice to meet you! I'm Klaas, 28 years old, and an aspiring functional analyst at SPF Finance. 
           I live in Eine near Oudenaarde and I'm really looking forward to getting to know you all.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a previous life I was the head of the sound department at the company I worked and a sound engineer.
            This gave me the opportunity to see the world and tour with corporate and public events and see places you can't visit otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had the luck to work at big events like Rock Werchter, Pukkelpop, Foute Party in Belgium and the Netherlands. 
            Mix and work with acts like Dua Lipa, The Script, Bebe Rexha, Armin Van Buuren, Davina Michel and the emperor of the flemish music Will Tura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunatly COVID-19 came and I had to think about other options. I always had a passion for IT and computers. And Switchfully gave me the opportunity to be an aspiring functional analyst!
