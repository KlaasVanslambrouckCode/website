            As a sound engineer you have to have a very diverse skill set. From electronics and electricty, to acoustics and mechanics. Everything is import in order to have a perfect show.

            The first and most important thing to consider is the source. If the source isn't good than it will never be possible to get it better. A good source and microphone placement is key to succes.

          Sound engineering is increasingly seen as a creative profession where musical instruments and technology are used to produce sound for film, radio, television, music and video games. Audio engineers also set up, sound check and do live sound mixing using a mixing console and a sound reinforcement system for music concerts, theatre, sports games and corporate events.

          Alternatively, audio engineer can refer to a scientist or professional engineer who holds an engineering degree and who designs, develops and builds audio or musical technology working under terms such as acoustical engineering, electronic/electrical engineering or (musical) signal processing.

        Live Sound engineer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Front of House (FOH) engineer – a person dealing with live sound reinforcement. This usually includes planning and installation of loudspeakers, cabling and equipment and mixing sound during the show.</li>
        <li>Wireless microphone engineer - This position is responsible for wireless microphones during a theatre production, a sports event or a corporate event.</li>
        <li>Foldback or Monitor engineer – a person running foldback sound during a live event. The term "foldback" comes from the old practice of "folding back" audio signals from the front of house (FOH) mixing console to the stage so musicians can hear themselves while performing.</li>
        <li>Systems engineer – responsible for the design setup of modern PA systems, which are often very complex.</li>
      </ul>
